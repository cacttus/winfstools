# WinFsTools

This is a suite of simple filesystem tools for Microsoft Windows. 

## AutoMove

AutoMove polls an application directory for added files, then moves those files to a new directory when it sees them.

## DeltaSearch (CHM-Search)

DeltaSearch is a paralell filesystem search utility with regular expression *and CHM* support.  The tool can  open CHM files and search through their contents.

## DirScan

DirScan scans directories for changes and launches an executable, or file (of any kind) when it detects a filesystem change.

## Flattener

Flattener simply flattens a directory tree, placing all the files it finds into a single folder.  Place the .exe file into a directory and run this tool.  The tool will give you options on how you wish to flatten the directory.  

## DeDuper

DeDuper removes duplicate files in a directory tree.  The tool also gives you custom name-matching options. In the future, this tool should support regular expression filetypes.

## Ganker

Ganker is a weird tool that lets you strip all of the media off of a webpage, and poll a webpage for new media.  When new media hits the page, the Ganker application will download the media.

##Rifle 

Rifle is a timer application that runs all files, execurables (or anything else), in the specified directory.  The aplication includes a stop-watch option so that you can time when items get executed.
