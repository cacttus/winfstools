# Dirscan
Dirscan is a simple tool that scans directories for file or folder changes then optionally executes a batch file program.  The changes to the directory are displayed in the output window.

## Getting Started
Essentially this is a tool useful for debugging file system changes.  This tool shows what changes are made to your file system in realtime.   It will also show disk access issues.

### Installing
Simply build the solution and run from /bin.  

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute.

## Future Features
* Add RULES for Batch file execution (when certain files change or dirs change). 
* Add a form that shows numeric usage, file access (similar to task manager).
