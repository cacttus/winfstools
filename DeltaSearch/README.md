# About
This tool can decompile and search through CHM files.  It is built in a similar manner to Agent Ransack.  

# Issues & Future Development
There is still quite a bit to be done with this tool.  The multi-core search capability is in place, but it isn't implemented.  That would be pretty easy to add.  

There is a bug searching the decompiled CHM HTML where the files get added twice.

Adding keyword highlighting to the search results pane would be helpful.

Doc + PDF switches do not currently work.
